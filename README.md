Framework of Trust

This project allows a person to set up a Smart Contract for the distribution of funds from a mining account. We have set up a mining pool shared by 7 individuals. As part of the smart contract each month the profits from the mining contract are distributed to each individual based on their share of the contract.

The Smart Contract owner has full power to add the 7 individuals and the share of the contract each individual has. As part of best practices, each individual must withdraw their share of the profits. Profits are accumulated in the smart contract each time the Mining pool account distributes the profits.

At any point the Smart Contract owner may end the life of the contract, at which point all funds are returned to the Smart Contract owner.

This software was built using the Truffle Framework. I would strongly suggest going there and learning; they have a cute tutorial on pets.
